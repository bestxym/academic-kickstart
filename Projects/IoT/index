This project aims to utilize the IoT and AI technologies to realize the holistic control of the source-grid-load-storage. Specifically, this project will build IoT devices with measurement, communication and control capabilities, develop the coordination/control strategies in the central control center and in the local IoT deveices, big data collection and analysis, AI based power system frequency regulation methods, and investigation of demand response on the customer and power systems.
